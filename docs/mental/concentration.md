## Concentration

### Tracking and Debriefing

### Metrics

### Self-Assessment

- in preparing for and engaging on a climb, I detach myself from
  outcome-oriented thought and the need of success and instead dwell on the
  process of climbing and the experience of the movement

### Objectives and Achievements

- make an inventory of your concentration killers:
  - sensory distractions
  - focusing on the past
  - focusing on the future
  - dwelling on internal feelings, sensations of fatigue
  - entertaining non-productive self-talk
  - focusing on the mechanics

### Exercises and Habits

- taking care of distractions before engaging in an activity
- use rituals to focus
- keep your eyes on task relevant targets
- clock drill
- singular focus climbing
- attention-shifting drill
- breathing
