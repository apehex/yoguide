##Â Willpower

### Tracking and Debriefing

### Metrics

### Self-Assessment

- I can push myself to an extreme level of fatigue and pain
- when the chips are down, I can perform up near my maximum
  ability and throw all I've got at a climb or goal
- I push myself through a long scary runout between bolts
  or gear, when I know either:
  - that the gear will hold a big fall
  - that I'm capable of climbing that section without falling
