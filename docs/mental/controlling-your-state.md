## Controlling your State

### Tracking and Debriefing

### Metrics

### Self-Assessment

- I get anxious, tight, and hesitant as I climb a crux sequence, and I have a
  tough time preventing this
- I get angry or frustrated when I struggle or fall on a route or encounter
  unexpected difficulties
- I can regain a positive mind-set and optimie arousal at reste positions, between
  attempts on a climb, or during a competition
- after a bad day of climbing or a poor road trip, I can quickly shake off
  the disappointment and regain a positive, productive, future-oriented frame of mind
- I can find a way to enjoy almost any day even if I'm not climbing well
  or things aren't going as planned
- if I'm feeling anxious or scared before a climb, I take a mental inventory of
  past successes and remind myself of my experience and preparation in order to
  create a more effective mental state for climbing
