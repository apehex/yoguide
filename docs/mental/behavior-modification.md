## Behavior Modification

### Tracking and Debriefing

### Metrics

### Self-Assessment

- I'm able to create motivation to train or climb when I'm feeling tired,
  depressed and unproductive
- I can give up things that I recognize are holding me back from my goals
- once I've identified them, I am able to break bad habits of mind and
  technique that limit my ability and slow progress
- when I find myself procrastinating, I can create positive energy and take
  some action toward a worthy goal
- when criticism and or other outside factors trigger negative thoughts and
  feelings, I can quickly let go of the anger and regain a positive,
  self-confident state

### Objectives and Achievements

- make an inventory of limiting behaviors:
  - situation
  - thoughts / reactions / habits
  - how I want to behave

### Exercises and Habits

- imagine the pain of inaction
- split tasks into smaller chunks:
  - with a well-defined goal
  - doable in one go (30min of pure focus)
- match your breathing with action
- walk, talk, act like you've got it
- the crux is to engage, then you're done
