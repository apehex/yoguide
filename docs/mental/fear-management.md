## Fear Management

### Tracking and Debriefing

### Metrics

### Self-Assessment

- I'm proactive in managing risk in order to reduce the fear factor, control
  arousal, and improve my chances for a safe, successful climb
- I become distracted due to the hardships and unknowns of the climb
- I get nervous and afraid heading up on an on-sight, project, or
  competition route
- I ponder the potential for embarassment and become anxious because of the
  uncertainty of the outcome
- when lead climbing a safe route, I push myself to the complete limit and,
  if I fall, I fall trying
- I make ecuses for why I might fail on a route before I even begin to climb

### Objectives and Achievements

- make an inventory of your fears, and for each one:
  - what are the triggers ?
  - look for objective reasons
  - can you reduce the risk:
    - with preparation
    - by proactiviely looking for clues
  - imagine and accept the possible outcomes
  - imagine the best reaction

### Exercises and Habits

- lead
- no top rope
- pass a roof
- climb overhanging wall
- jump at the end of the climb
- falling xx times
- finishing after falling
- take practice falls
- change the interpretation of the fear signals
- breath
- interpret failure and criticism as opportunities to improve
- accept the unknown: if you wanted to stay in the routine, you shouldn't
  have gone out
