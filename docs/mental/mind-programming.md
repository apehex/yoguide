## Mind Programming

### Tracking and Debriefing

### Metrics

### Self-Assessment

- I visualize strategy, process, and the ideal outcome in all important tasks
  I undertake
- in preparing for a difficul climb, I strive to preprogram the ascent by
  vividly visualizing myself climbing the route, feeling the moves, before
  I leave the ground
- I use self-talk and mantras to maintain focus, aid execution, and sustain
  effort during a hard undertaking
- I try to stimulate the moves and muscleaction needed for a current project
  or upcoming climb
- I engage in meditation, visualization, or some form of mental exercise to
  prepare my mind and body for future activities and goals
- in the time leading up to an important goal, I utilize rituals and routines
  that past experience has proven to put me in the best frame of mind and
  physical state for peak performance

### Objectives and Achievements
