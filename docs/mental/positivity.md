## Positivity

### Tracking and Debriefing

### Metrics

### Self-Assessment

- when faced with a tough situation or unexpected adversity, I get inspired
  and accept the challenge
- in the wake of an adverse situation, I spin the negative outcome into
  something positive by identifying a lesson learned or determining a way
  that it has made me stronger
- when I get up in the morning,I emmediately think positive, productive
  thoughts that will help prepare me for the challenges of the day

### Exercises and Habits

- be a spin-doctor: keep the good
- use optimism as a tool: assume a positive outcome, look for the motivating
- reverse paranoid: things support me toward success (imagine if xxx didn't exist)
