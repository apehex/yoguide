## Searching for the Right Movement

### Tracking and Debriefing

### Metrics

### Self-Assessment

- I think about, experiment with, and strive to discover ways
  to become a more efficient climber
- I seek out and force myself onto climbs that will teach me
  new skills or shore up techniques at which I lack in proficiency
- I concentrate on the feeling of my body and strive to use this
  information to improve my performance
- I work boulder problems, sequences, or entire routes beyond the point of crude
  success with the goal of developping precise, economical movement skills

### Objectives and Achievements

### Exercises and Habits

- practice climbing
- trial and error rather than rationalizing
- blocked pratice = repeating movements
- try and master each route, do not be content of just sending
- fatigued pratice to nail a movement / sequence, be most efficient
- restricted pratice:
  - frog-leg
  - high-step
  - tennis ball
  - straight arm
