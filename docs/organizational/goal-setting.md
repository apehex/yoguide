## Goal Setting

### Tracking and Debriefing

### Metrics

### Self-Assessment

- I set specific goals for my daily training and each climbing outing, as
  opposed to making it up on the go
- at some point each week, I review my long-term climbing and life goals, then
  mentally work backward to determine what short-term actions I should take
  to remain on course

### Objectives and Achievements

### Exercises and Habits

- set long-term goals, make them challenging and meaningful
- ... short-term ...
- ... life ...
- identify gaps and motivations to improve
