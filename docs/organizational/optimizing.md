### Tracking and Debriefing

### Metrics

### Self-Assessment

- I direct my practice sessions -and perform specific drills- to expand the
  breadth and depth of my skills
- I thoughtfully design my workouts to train up my weaknesses and ultimately
  to provide the greatest payoff for the time I have available to invest
  in training

### Objectives and Achievements

### Exercises and Habits

- session types
- climbing styles and locations
