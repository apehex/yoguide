## Full Body Strength

### Tracking and Debriefing

### Metrics

### Self-Assessment

- I engage in some kind of reactive or hypergravity training to condition my
  nervous system to function more efficientlyt during severe climbing movements

### Objectives and Achievements

### Exercises and Habits

- hypergravity: weighted boulder / finger hang / HIT
- reactive: one arm lunging / campus touching
- "complex training": alternate between boulders and musculation
